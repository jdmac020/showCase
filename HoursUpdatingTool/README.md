A program developed for my wife to make updating a spreadsheet of restaurant hours more streamlined. Required importing data from an Excel file, converting to POCO objects, manipulating through forms, and then updating the same Excel file.

Still needs work; variations in cell location can still throw unhandled exceptions during import/export if the source file is not identical to the one initially provided to me.
